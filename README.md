# Telecom_Churn_with_ML_Techniques
Telecom churn Case Study Using Logistic Regression , Random Forest and Decision Tree

Problem Statement
You have a telecom firm that has collected data of all its customers. The main types of attributes are as follows:

Demographics (age, gender, etc.)
Services availed (internet packs purchased, special offers taken, etc.)
Expenses (amount of recharge done per month, etc.)
Based on all this past information, you want to build a model that will predict whether a particular customer will churn or not, i.e., whether they will switch to a different service provider or not. So, the variable of interest, i.e., the target variable here is ‘Churn’, which will tell us whether or not a particular customer has churned. It is a binary variable where 1 means that the customer has churned and 0 means that the customer has not churned.
